# Our most excellent code of conduct

## Our purpose
The fundamental purpose of this community is to bring people together to create
and have a most triumphant time with the SIP protocol. We are all part of the
same cosmic band, and we need to help each other hit the high notes.

## Our excellent standards
We are all historical figures, and our actions will echo throughout time. To
ensure a utopian future, we pledge to uphold the following principles:

**1. Show respect and kindness.**
*   Treat others with the same care and consideration you would want for yourself.
*   Actively listen to one another. You never know when someone might have a most non-heinous idea.
*   Gracefully accept constructive criticism. It's how we all get better at our air guitar solos.

**2. Embrace diversity and inclusion.**
*   Our band is made up of people from all of time and space. We welcome and support everyone, regardless of their background, beliefs, or the era they hail from.
*   Discrimination and harassment are most heinous and will not be tolerated.

**3. Spread positivity.**
*   Look for the good in every person and every idea.
*   Offer encouragement and help others succeed in their journey to achieve their destiny.

## When things get bogus
We understand that sometimes, even excellent people have off days. If you
witness or experience a violation of this code, please inform a community
leader immediately. We are available to help you in your time of most
distress.

## Consequences
*   For minor offenses, we will gently remind you of the community's excellent standards.
*   For repeated or serious violations, we may need to ban you from the community. Remember, a most excellent society requires us all to get along.

## In conclusions

Be excellent to each other.

Party on dudes!
