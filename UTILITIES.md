# Utilities

Along with the spycraft service itself, this package includes what I hope will
be a growing number of support utilities and commands.

## sipdump

This allows you to extract sip messages related to a single endpoint in whole
either live or from a .pcap file.

## sipfind

This attempts to identify and list active sip endpoints in your network
traffic or in a .pcap file. This can help you identify hosts you may want to
run spycraft or other analysis tools on.
